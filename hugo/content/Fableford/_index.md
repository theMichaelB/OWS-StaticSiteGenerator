    title: Open World Stories
    content: Where Every Character has a Narrative
---

**Imagine a world built not by a single author, but by a community. A world where every character, no matter how seemingly small, has a voice, a history, and a future shaped by the collective imagination of many.**

That's the vision behind Open World Stories: a collaborative creative writing project that reimagines how stories are told, and how readers experience them. We're building a universe where every character is a protagonist, and every writer contributes to a larger, ever-evolving narrative tapestry.
